## Motivation
I chose to explore CFPB Enforcement Relief & Penalties because of my strong interest in financial regulation and its impact on businesses and consumers. Understanding how enforcement actions shape corporate behavior, consumer protection, and market stability is crucial in today’s financial landscape. By analyzing the patterns of penalties and relief measures, I aim to gain deeper insights into regulatory effectiveness and its broader economic implications.
